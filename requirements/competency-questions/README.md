This file contains a list of competency questions, the vocabulary aims to answer.

* The *ID* column should identify each question with a numerical ID prefixed by the letters *CQ*
* The *Question* column should state the question
* The *Expected Answer* column should state the expected answer
* The *Motivating Scenario*
* The *SPARQL query* column should state the name of the SPARQL query file, located in this folder

| ID   | Question                           | Expected Answer                   | Motivating Scenario | SPARQL query          |
