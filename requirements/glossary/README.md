| Restriction Type                         | rdfcv:SimpleConstraint, prov:Entity | Object | Restrictions can be divided into different types, e.g. cardinality or subsumption. The [RDF-CV](https://github.com/boschthomas/RDF-Constraints-Vocabulary) vocabulary defines restriction types in a generic way. | LOVCube paper, related work by Hartmann [xx] | @slieber | @slieber | 
| Restriction Type Expression              | qb:DimensionProperty| Object | A restriction type can be expressed differently, e.g. disjointness can be modeled using *owl:disjointWith* or *owl:AllDisjointClasses*. Which Restriction Type Expression was used to gather a result, is also important provenance information, thus it should also be a statistical dimension of the result dataset. | LOVCube paper | @slieber | @slieber |
| Restriction Type Metric                  | qb:MeasureProperty | Object | Different statistical metrics can be computed to gather insights regarding modeled restrictions. | LOVCube paper | @slieber | @slieber |
| Restriction Type Detector                | frbr:Work, prov:Entity | Object | One detector is responsible to gather information of one Restriction Type Expression. | | @slieber | @slieber |
| Restriction Type Detector Version        | qb:MeasureProperty, frbr:Expression, prov:Entity | Object | A detector can be subject of changes. For correctness, an older result should not be linked to a newer version of a detector. Thus provenance is important and different versions need to be explicit. | | @slieber | @slieber |
| Restriction Type Detector Implementation | qb:MeasureProperty, prov:Entity | Object | A detector can be implemented using different languages. One Restriction Type Expression might be detected using a SPARQL query, or a LODStats module. Software is prone to errors, to later trace back how a result was created, the implementation is necessary provenance information. | | @slieber | @slieber |
| Ontology | Vocabulary | Object | The ontology of which Restriction Type Metrics are created | | @slieber | @slieber |
| Dataset | Statistical Dataset, LOVCube Dataset, qb:DataSet | Object | A statistical dataset described using the LOVCube vocabulary. | LOVCube paper | @slieber | @slieber |
| Data Structure Definition | qb:DataStructureDefinition | Object | Defines the structure of a DataSet or slice. | Data Cube Spec | @slieber | @slieber |
| Dataset creation | | Process | The execution of one or multiple Restriction Type Detector Versions on an ontology. | | @slieber | @slieber |
