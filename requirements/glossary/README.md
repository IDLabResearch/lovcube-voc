| Restriction Type                  | | | Restrictions can be divided into different types, e.g. cardinality or subsumption | LOVCube paper, related work by Hartmann [xx] | @slieber | @slieber | 
| Restriction Type Expression       | qb:DimensionProperty| | A restriction type can be expressed differently, e.g. disjointness can be modeled using *owl:disjointWith* or *owl:AllDisjointClasses*. How a restriction type is expressed is also a statistical dimension of the result dataset. | LOVCube paper | @slieber | @slieber |
