| Restriction Definition                   | rdfcv:SimpleConstraint           | Object      | The [RDF-CV](https://github.com/boschthomas/RDF-Constraints-Vocabulary) vocabulary defines restriction types in a generic way. | Hartmann [xx] | @slieber | @slieber |
| has Restriction Definition               |                                  | Complex Property | Linking a Restriction Type to a Restriction Definition. | | @slieber | @slieber |
| Restriction Type                         | prov:Entity | Object | Restrictions can be divided into different types, e.g. cardinality or subsumption. | LOVCube paper, related work by Hartmann [xx] | @slieber | @slieber | 
| Restriction Type Expression              | qb:DimensionProperty, prov:Entity | Object | A restriction type can be expressed differently, e.g. disjointness can be modeled using *owl:disjointWith* or *owl:AllDisjointClasses*. Which Restriction Type Expression was used to gather a result, is also important provenance information, thus it should also be a statistical dimension of the result dataset. | LOVCube paper | @slieber | @slieber |
| Restriction Type Measure                  | qb:MeasureProperty | Object | Different statistical measures can be computed to gather insights regarding modeled restrictions. | LOVCube paper | @slieber | @slieber |
| Restriction Type Detector                | frbr:Work, prov:Entity | Object | One detector is responsible to gather information of one Restriction Type Expression. | | @slieber | @slieber |
| Restriction Type Detector Version        | qb:MeasureProperty, frbr:Expression, prov:Entity | Object | A detector can be subject of changes. For correctness, an older result should not be linked to a newer version of a detector. Thus provenance is important and different versions need to be explicit. | | @slieber | @slieber |
| Restriction Type Detector Implementation | qb:MeasureProperty, prov:Entity | Object | A detector can be implemented using different languages. One Restriction Type Expression might be detected using a SPARQL query, or a LODStats module. Software is prone to errors, to later trace back how a result was created, the implementation is necessary provenance information. | | @slieber | @slieber |
| Restriction Type Statistic               | qb:Observation, prov:Entity | Object | A qb:Observation created by a *Dataset creation* process. | | @slieber | @slieber |
| Ontology | Vocabulary | Object | The ontology of which Restriction Type Metrics are created | | @slieber | @slieber |
| Dataset | Statistical Dataset, LOVCube Dataset, qb:DataSet, prov:Entity | Object | A statistical dataset described using the LOVCube vocabulary. | LOVCube paper | @slieber | @slieber |
| Data Structure Definition | qb:DataStructureDefinition, LOVCube Dataset Definition | Object | Defines the structure of a DataSet or slice. | Data Cube Spec | @slieber | @slieber |
| Dataset creation | prov:Activity | Process | The execution of one or multiple Restriction Type Detector Versions on an ontology. | | @slieber | @slieber |
