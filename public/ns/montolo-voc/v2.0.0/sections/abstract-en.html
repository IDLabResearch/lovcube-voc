<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">

<p>
The MontoloVoc vocabulary has the purpose to describe
concepts and statistical measures regarding RDF data models.
</p>

<p>
Besides a vocabulary of terms, RDF data models usually also contain
restrictions in the form of axioms (e.g. RDFS or OWL) or constraints (SHACL or ShEx).
In the current version MontoloVoc provides concepts to describe
restriction types (e.g. disjoint classes) and different measurable expressions
of it, such as <code>owl:disjointWith</code> or <code>owl:AllDisjointClasses</code>.
</p>

<p>
Instances of such restriction type and expressions as well as statistical measures
can be found in Montolo (https://w3id.org/montolo/ns/montolo)
and concrete statistics about axioms in MontoloStats (https://w3id.org/montolo)
and about constraints in MontoloSHACLStats (https://zenodo.org/record/3988930).
